# Branch and Bound Algorithm for solving KNN

- Borrowed a B&B implementation (for binary integer programming) from [jianyi1995/branch-and-bound](jianyi1995/branch-and-bound)

- Followed the paper [Learning to Branch](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10150.pdf) to formulate KNN (in graph perspective, which produces resutls with tiny differneces from classic KNN) as a B&B problem
