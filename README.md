# Branch & Bound Algorithm for solving K-means

- Borrowed a B&B implementation (for binary integer programming) from [jianyi1995/branch-and-bound](https://github.com/jianyi1995/branch-and-bound)

- Followed the paper [Learning to Branch](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10150.pdf) to formulate K-means (in graph perspective, which produces resutls with tiny differneces from classic K-means) as a B&B problem
